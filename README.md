Full-Stack To-Do App

This full-stack to-do application features a backend HTTP server with filesystem-based persistence, ensuring your tasks are saved and retained even after refreshing the page. The app includes a dynamic task management system where you can add, view, and manage tasks effortlessly.

Key Features:

Backend and Frontend Integration: A backend server that handles task data storage and retrieval.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in the filesystem to maintain data integrity across page refreshes.
Task Management: Add, view, and manage tasks with ease.

Note: The application is currently not responsive but serves as a foundational example of full-stack development with persistent storage.
